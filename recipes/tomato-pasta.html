    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>For this simple garlic and tomato pasta recipe, there is nothing nicer than the flavor of fresh tomatoes.</p>
    <p>You can use canned, but the trouble you take to prepare this dish is worth it.</p>
    <p>You prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking, no long hours of waiting.</p>
    <p>Great if you want meatless pasta.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds tomatoes</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>

        <li> 4 cloves crushed garlic</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>

        <li>salt to taste</li>

        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>

        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place tomatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring just to a boil. Pour off water, and cover
            again with cold water. Peel the skin off tomatoes and cut into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet or pan, making sure there is enough to cover the bottom of the
            pan, and sauté garlic until opaque but not browned. Stir in tomato paste. <br> Immediately stir in the tomatoes,
            salt, and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer until pasta is ready, adding basil at the end.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, do not rinse in cold water. Toss with a bit of olive oil, then mix into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat as low as possible. Keep warm, uncovered, for about 10 minutes when it is ready to serve.
            Garnish generously with fresh Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
